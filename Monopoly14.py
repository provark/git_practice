    # I'm using try/except for players 3 & 4 to avoid NameErrors.
    # Specifically, without the try/except, if only 2 players in game, I would get an error after player 2 turn (NameError: name 'Player3' is not defined).
    # This is because I chose to create Players by first creating a player list and then
    # defining each Player instance based on the index of players in that list. (I probably could have done it differently). This means that I can only
    # define Players 3 and 4 on condition that player_list contains 3 and 4 players, respectively (otherwise index out of range error). So Player3 is only defined
    # if player_list contains 3 items. But, without try/except, if there are only 2 players, the program tries to run the Player3 code but does not recognize Player3
    # (Player3 not defined because player list < 3). If instead of try/except I try something like elif len(player_list) > 3, the game won't work if only Player3 and Player1,
    # for example, are left in the game.
